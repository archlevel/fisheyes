        <p>Security Statement</p>
        <p>This Statement is, except where separate and distinctive statements are provided, applicable to iChano Incorporation. Accordingly, references to “we”, “us”, or “our company” etc. mean, as the case may be, the relevant company within iChano Incorporation.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>While the Internet is not an inherently secure environment for communication, Internet communication can be made safer by the application of appropriate technology as we have done. Internet security, however, is not solely a &quot;technology&quot; issue. Common sense and normal practice in safeguarding personal data are of equal importance. &quot;Hackers&quot; need a &quot;door&quot; to get into the system. Often, access through this &quot;door&quot; is provided to &quot;hackers&quot; due to simple carelessness in the physical distribution of sensitive documents and the handling of sensitive data (such as passwords or personal identification numbers). Users must, therefore, handle such sensitive documents and data with extreme care.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>We take security matters very seriously and treat all personally identifiable information obtained from users of our websites confidential. In addition to the firewalls and other sophisticated equipment implemented, we also provide and maintain the following measures to protect our system, and the information and data contained in them from accidental or malicious disruption or destruction.</p>
